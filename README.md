# Hi there, I'm Holger ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
Iâ€™m a **Full Stack Software Developer** working at the [GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences](https://www.gfz.de/staff/holger.ehrmann/sec51) in Potsdam, Germany.  
My main focus is on **Research Data Management (RDM)**, where I design and develop tools that make scientific work with research data more efficient and sustainable.
